Collaborative Checkers Game 2017

For now, we plan to write a 1v1 mode for a checkers game.

After we do so, we plan to use tkinter to generate a game board and simulate the game real time (hopefully).

After that, we plan on building an AI for human vs computer mode.

Then we have a game we can showcase for next year! Along with some experiecne with tkinter, Git, and collaborative coding.
